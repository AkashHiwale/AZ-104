## üìå What Are Resource Locks?

Azure Resource Locks help you **prevent accidental deletion or modification** of your resources.

They are particularly useful for protecting critical infrastructure in your environment.

---

## üîê Types of Locks

1. **Read-only (`CanNotDelete`)**:
   - Users can **read** and **list** resources.
   - **Modifications and deletions are blocked**.
   - It‚Äôs similar to assigning a **Reader** role but enforced at the **management level**.

2. **Delete (`ReadOnly`)**:
   - Allows reading and modifying resources.
   - **Prevents deletion** of the resource.

## üìç Where Can You Apply Locks?

- **Subscription level**
- **Resource Group level**
- **Individual Resource level**

> üîÑ Locks are **inherited** by child resources.  
> For example, if you apply a lock at the Resource Group level, all resources inside it inherit the lock.

## üö´ Limitations and Notes

# Availability Sets

Availability Sets are a logical grouping of virtual machines that help reduce the chances of multiple VMs going down due to hardware failure.

---

## ðŸ§± What Are Availability Sets?

- Used to increase the **availability** of your application.
- When you assign VMs to an availability set, each VM is automatically placed in a **separate fault domain** and **update domain**.
- This ensures your VMs are distributed across isolated infrastructure resources.

---

## âš¡ Fault Domains

- Fault domains define a group of machines that **share a common power source and network switch**.
- This setup helps protect against **hardware failures**.
- Azure allows up to **3 fault domains** (depending on the region).

---

## ðŸ”„ Update Domains

- Update domains define a group of VMs and physical hosts that can be **rebooted at the same time**.
- Used during **planned maintenance** to ensure not all VMs go down together.
- Azure supports up to **20 update domains**.

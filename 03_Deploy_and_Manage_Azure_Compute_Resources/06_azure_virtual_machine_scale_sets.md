# Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)

Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets help you to create and manage a group of **load-balanced virtual machines**.

---

## ⚙️ What Does It Do?

- Lets you deploy and manage a set of identical VMs.
- The number of virtual machines can **automatically grow or shrink** based on:
  - **Demand** (autoscaling)
  - A **defined schedule** (manual or scheduled scaling)

---

## 📈 Why Use VMSS?

- Helps with **scalability** – user traffic can be **distributed across multiple VMs** to handle load efficiently.
- Ideal for **high-availability** and **auto-recovery** scenarios.

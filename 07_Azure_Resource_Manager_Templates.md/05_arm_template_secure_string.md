# üßë‚Äçüíª ARM Template - Secure String

---

## üìå What is Secure String?

- Secure String in ARM templates is used to handle sensitive data, such as passwords, connection strings, or API keys.
- Secure strings are encrypted during deployment to ensure that sensitive data is protected and not exposed in the template or in the Azure portal.
- These values are never visible in clear text in the template or during deployment.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Syntax for Secure String

- The secure string data type is specified in the parameters section of an ARM template.
- Use the `secureString` type to define a parameter that will hold sensitive information.
- You can reference these parameters within the template, and they will be securely handled during the deployment process.

> Add secureString as a parameter type when you need to store sensitive data securely in the template.

### Example for defining a Secure String parameter:

``` json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "adminPassword": {
      "type": "secureString",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "The admin password for the VM"
      }
    }
  },
  "resources": []
}
```

## üß± How Secure String Works

- **Encryption**: The value of a secure string is encrypted during deployment and is not exposed in any logs or output.
- **Use in Resources**: Secure strings can be referenced in resource properties (like virtual machine admin credentials or storage account keys) but will not be exposed in the Azure Portal or deployment outputs.
- **Automatic Handling**: Azure automatically handles the secure string by encrypting and decrypting it when the deployment is performed.

## üß† Use Cases for Secure String

1. **Storing Sensitive Credentials**:
   - Secure strings are ideal for storing administrative credentials, database connection strings, or API keys that need to remain confidential.
   
2. **Avoiding Plain Text Exposure**:
   - Using secureString ensures that sensitive values are never stored as plain text in the template or logs.
   
3. **Secure Deployment**:
   - When deploying infrastructure that requires sensitive values like passwords or keys (e.g., VM creation with an admin password), secure strings help ensure these values are kept safe.

## ‚ùå Limitations of Secure String

- **Cannot be Used for Outputs**: Secure string parameters cannot be returned as output from the ARM template. They are encrypted and cannot be directly viewed after deployment.
- **No Runtime Evaluation**: Secure string values are only handled securely during deployment time and are not evaluated dynamically during runtime.

## üß† Exam Tips

- Understand the use case for secure string parameters and how they help protect sensitive data during template deployment.
- Know that secure strings are handled by Azure as encrypted values and are not exposed in the portal or logs.
- Be familiar with the syntax for defining and referencing secure string parameters in ARM templates.
